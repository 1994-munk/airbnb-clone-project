## 📊 Database Design

Our database is structured around 5 key entities that mirror real-world Airbnb functionality.  
Each entity has its own fields and connects with others to form relationships.  

---

### 👤 Users
- **Fields**: `id`, `name`, `email`, `password`, `role`
- **Relationships**:
  - A user can **list multiple properties** 🏠
  - A user can **make multiple bookings** 📅
  - A user can **write reviews** ✍️

---

### 🏠 Properties
- **Fields**: `id`, `title`, `description`, `location`, `price_per_night`
- **Relationships**:
  - A property belongs to **one user** (the host) 👤
  - A property can have **many bookings** 📅
  - A property can receive **many reviews** ⭐

---

### 📅 Bookings
- **Fields**: `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `start_date`, `end_date`
- **Relationships**:
  - A booking belongs to **one user** 👤
  - A booking is for **one property** 🏠
  - A booking is tied to **one payment** 💳

---

### 💳 Payments
- **Fields**: `id`, `booking_id`, `amount`, `status`, `payment_date`
- **Relationships**:
  - A payment is linked to **one booking** 📅
  - Each booking has **one payment record**  

---

### ⭐ Reviews
- **Fields**: `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `rating`, `comment`
- **Relationships**:
  - A review belongs to **one user** 👤
  - A review belongs to **one property** 🏠
  - A property can have **many reviews** ⭐⭐⭐

---

✨ This design ensures a clear and scalable structure where users, properties, bookings, payments, and reviews are connected just like in the real Airbnb platform.





## ✨ Feature Breakdown  

Our Airbnb Clone comes packed with essential features that bring the full rental experience to life. Each feature plays a unique role in ensuring smooth interactions between users, property owners, and the platform.  

### 👤 User Management  
Users can sign up, log in, and manage their profiles. This feature ensures secure authentication and allows users to update personal details, view their bookings, and manage account settings.  

### 🏡 Property Management  
Hosts can list new properties with details like photos, descriptions, pricing, and availability. This feature empowers hosts to showcase their spaces and gives users a variety of choices when searching for accommodations.  

### 📅 Booking System  
Guests can search, select, and book available properties based on dates and preferences. The system ensures availability checks, prevents double bookings, and provides smooth reservation handling.  

### 💳 Payment Integration  
A secure payment gateway is integrated to handle transactions between guests and hosts. This feature ensures safe and reliable payments, giving both sides confidence in the process.  

### ⭐ Reviews & Ratings  
Guests can leave reviews and ratings after their stay. This feature builds trust in the community, helps future guests make informed choices, and gives hosts feedback for improvement.  

### 🔍 Search & Filters  
Users can search for properties by location, price, availability, and amenities. This makes it easy for guests to find exactly what they’re looking for without endless scrolling.  

### 📱 Responsive Design  
The platform is built to work seamlessly across devices (desktop, tablet, mobile). This ensures users can book or manage properties anytime, anywhere.  



## 🔒 API Security  

Securing our APIs is a top priority to protect user data, ensure safe transactions, and maintain trust. The following security measures will be implemented:  

### 🔑 Authentication  
Only registered users can access protected endpoints through **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**.  
👉 Ensures that only verified users can log in, book properties, or make payments.  

### 🛂 Authorization  
Different user roles (e.g., **Guest, Host, Admin**) will have controlled access.  
👉 Prevents unauthorized actions, such as a guest trying to modify another host’s property listing.  

### ⏱️ Rate Limiting  
APIs will restrict the number of requests per user within a time window.  
👉 Protects against **brute-force attacks** and ensures system stability.  

### 🧑‍💻 Input Validation & Sanitization  
All inputs will be validated and sanitized before processing.  
👉 Prevents common vulnerabilities like **SQL injection** and **XSS attacks**.  

### 🔐 Secure Payments  
All financial transactions will use **encrypted channels (HTTPS + TLS)** and third-party secure gateways.  
👉 Guarantees that sensitive payment details remain safe.  

### 🛡️ Data Privacy & Encryption  
Sensitive user data (like passwords) will be hashed, and communications will always occur over **HTTPS**.  
👉 Protects personal information from leaks or unauthorized access.

✨ **Why this matters:**  
- **Protecting user data** → Safeguards personal and financial details.  
- **Securing payments** → Builds trust and confidence between hosts and guests.  
- **System integrity** → Prevents downtime and ensures fair use of resources.  
- **Community trust** → A secure platform keeps users returning.  



## ⚙️ CI/CD Pipeline  

A **CI/CD pipeline (Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment)** automates the process of building, testing, and deploying our Airbnb Clone project. This ensures faster development cycles, fewer bugs, and smooth delivery of new features.  

### 🔄 Why it’s Important  
- ✅ **Continuous Integration (CI):** Automatically runs tests whenever new code is pushed. This helps catch bugs early and keeps the main branch stable.  
- 🚀 **Continuous Deployment (CD):** Automates the release process so that updates can quickly and safely reach production.  
- 🛠️ **Consistency & Reliability:** Reduces human error and guarantees that every release follows the same tested process.  

### 🧰 Tools We’ll Use  
- **GitHub Actions** → Automate builds, tests, and deployments directly from our repo.  
- **Docker** → Containerize the app for consistent environments across development and production.  
- **Jest / Mocha (Testing Frameworks)** → Run automated tests before merging new code.  
- **Heroku / AWS / Vercel** → Deploy the app seamlessly with CI/CD workflows.  

---

✨ **In short:**  
CI/CD is like our **project’s autopilot** 🛩️ → code goes in, tests run automatically, and if everything passes, a fresh version of the app is deployed without hassle.
